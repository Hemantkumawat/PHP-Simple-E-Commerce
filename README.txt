The admin account for the admin panel is:
•	Username: admin@admin.com
•	Password: admin
•	Signin As: admin

The objective of this project was to simulate an e-commerce shop selling seating tickets which customers can buy. It includes a signup page for customers and an admin panel that shows information about the customers, orders, and see what has been sold or what is still available in the shop. Also all input fields all get validated in case if a user tries putting incorrect information in any field and it won’t accept it, try it out! (Such as a number in a name when signing up, an incorrect password, an expired credit card date etc..)
This site is a demonstration to show my skills with PHP. The current project incorporates:
•	Working with Databases using MySQL: Adding, editing, retrieving and deleting data
•	Forms and input validation: Stopping users from inputting the incorrect format when they put in something wrong and then displaying the error. Such as a user tries to sign in with an incorrect password, a number is entered in the name field when signing up, a user tries to buy an item that’s already sold out, etc...
•	Passing or receiving data from numerous different pages/files: Using PHP POST, GET and MySQL
•	Arrays, variables, loops
•	Efficiency: Have the same page behave differently depending on the condition. (Such as a shop page letting customers buy tickets meanwhile letting an admin see what’s in stock.)

Please don’t use any real/personal information on the site! It’s a demo only! Use random numbers for a credit ca and 123abc for the password when signing up!

You can also run the files on your own if you have a server running PHP and MySQL: 
Import the SQL file in a new database called "ticket" (no caps/quotations).
The current database configuration is: ("localhost","root","root")
	database address: localhost
	username: root
	password: root
If you find and replace the term ("localhost","root","root") in all the files and replace it with your info: ("Database address","Username","Password") you can get it working! The main file is Main.php.
